## MyQuran Indonesia: Privacy policy

Welcome to the MyQuran Indonesia app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Rommy Zamanuddin. the app is also available on Google Play.

As an Android user myself, I take privacy seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (app preferences (like bookmark etc.) created by the user is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
